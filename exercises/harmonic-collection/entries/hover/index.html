  <br> <h3>Popularly listed as one of the "Four Great Inventions" of China, the compass was invented by Chinese between the 2nd century BC and 1st century AD. It was first used in Feng Shui, the layout of buildings. By 1000 AD, navigational compasses were commonly used on Chinese ships, enabling them to navigate.</h3>
